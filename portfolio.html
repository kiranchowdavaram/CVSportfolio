            Comparison between precast engineering buildings and conventional steel buildings.
            precast building is made up of steel these building are engineered at factory an assemble at site and it is also cheaper to maintain and requires fewer man hours to install without compromising safety and quality and conventional steel buildings are consisting of steel brick and cement sections and these are fabricated and these are assembled at site and these methods involves welding and cutting which is done largely at construction sites.
